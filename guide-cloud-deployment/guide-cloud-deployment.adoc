== [.label]#Guide →# Amazon EC2

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.

There are several options for running on EC2, depending on what you want to do, detailed below.

=== Enterprise Causal Cluster in AWS Marketplace

This option launches a multi-VM clustered configuration, with the choice to configure a number of aspects of the
cluster, including number of core nodes, read replicas, hardware sizing, encrypted EBS volumes, and other options.

=== Launching Directly from an AMI

Instructions for launching VMs directly using Amazon's command line tool are provided 
in the article on link:/developer/guide-cloud-deployment/neo4j-cloud-aws-ec2-ami[Deploying Neo4j on EC2 using a custom Neo4j AMI].
Using this method, both Community and Enterprise options are available.

=== Community Edition in AWS Marketplace
